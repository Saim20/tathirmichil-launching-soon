    quote: "I was very reluctant about having tutors during the admission season because I very scared of doing my best and still failing. But I still decided to give tthrvy's course a shot and man am I glad that I did. The classes and slides were so fun and interesting that I even paid attention to permutation combination classes. Besides, the peers were such great company and they also kept me on my toes so that i wouldn't slack off. However, the only con about the course is that you don't get to do it over and over again. Thank you tthrvy for this amazing journey and for believing in me. Like your effort towards my success, my gratefulness also has no bounds.(P.S.: sorry for not completing the roadmap)",

I‚Äôll always be grateful for the time I spent here, irrespective of my results.",

Every class ppt gave testimony to the amount of effort it required to come up with such well-curated slides. Tthrvy was, is and will always be peerless in teaching concepts and approaches but more importantly, he played the role of a coach who pushed me to give it my very best. If it was not for him, I would've never put this much effort. And, the course was never limited to classes and sessions, Tthrvy was always on the top 3 of my inbox. I texted him whenever I had self-doubt or anxiety. Thanks for making me a better and more hardworking person Bhai.",

Attending his lectures and following his guidance were more than enough for thorough preparation. The exams in this course are of exceptional quality, designed precisely to enhance one‚Äôs aptitude. And bhaiya not only focused on the academic aspects of my admission journey but also made a sincere effort to ensure my mental well-being, helping me stay motivated throughout the process. Being in his course came with the constant reassurance that whatever problem I faced, I would have someone who would try his best to solve it. I'll always be glad that I chose Tathir bhaiya as my mentor.",

Joining his class was one of the best decisions I took. Apart from being an extremely dedicated teacher, he's just the kindest person I know. You can really feel his vibrant energy during his classes which really helps you keep going in hard times. Even after having more than a hundred students, he always finds the time to give a student the invididual attention he/she needs. You won't just get a great mentor, you'll get a support system and an amazing community. And bhaiya onek onek resources dey; sharadin koreo shesh korte parba na",

When I joined his course, it was pretty late in the admission season( Ami crash batch don‚Äôt hate meüòî) and the only thing I regret about joining his course is not joining it earlier. IBA is full of amazing tutors and of course a lot of people have amazingly organised content but I have always felt that it‚Äôs not Tathir Bhai‚Äôs extremely structured lessons that make him Tathir bhai rather it‚Äôs the magnitude of efforts that he puts in for every soul that he mentors. I mean who arranges a session every other night just to make sure his students don‚Äôt feel lost? Who listens to your rants till 1 at night and takes classes on anything you name just to make sure that you know someone‚Äôs got your back? Tathir bhai does. (Ami onk pore ashchi dekhe kom paisi but you get a lot of treats tooüòó). Every penny that I spent on this course is way beyond than just worth it and Tathir bhai‚Äôs support during my darkest days is something I will never forget. I want to say a lot more but let‚Äôs just finish with something very clich√© which is,‚ÄùProud and blessed to be a part of the michil.",

    quote: "If I rewind 5 months back, I think that I took the best decision to get in Tathirvy's course. I always told my family, and will always tell that if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be able to make into IBA. I never came across any man like him. The insane dedication he had for us in the entire admission phase, perhaps we didn't have that much dedication at all. From the classes, to the resources, slides, weekly exams, vocab jams everything was very curated. I remember of getting 7.25 in my first random mock test. But in the entire course, I improved so much, learned so much from him. The study materials ain't that hard actually for IBA admissions, anyone can teach that. But why tthrvy? I would say the wholesome community. My admission phase was very exhausting, but in the same sense I had insane fun with my batch. I made great friends and we were there for eachother till the end. Tathirvy made us love this journey so much that when the IBA exam finished, we became so emotional thinking that we won't get his random 7/11pm sessions. So yeah, the experience was ecstatic. Any aspirant will get the best resources out there for iba admissions in this course, and will get the best instructor to ever exist. tthr michil forever üí™üèΩ",

    quote: "When I started my admission journey, I was in a dilemma regarding which way to pursue, which sector has a better future to offer, and last but not least, where I have a good chance. Then it's tthrvy whose guidance, assessments, and motivation encouraged me to take a leap of faith and follow the IBA pursuit, forsaking the engineering preparation. I still believe I couldn't make it if tthrvy weren't there. The quality of his classes, resources and exam hall strategies is undisputable in the market. The variability of the question difficulty of his exams made me habituated to exam hall uncertainties. Whenever I felt lost or overwhelmed, I could resort to tthrvy and trust me when I say this, this guy can motivate you even after making you encounter harsh reality checks. If you are looking for the best classes, resources, exam hall strategies, late-night yapping, and delicious treats,tthrvy is the guy ‚Äîmy literal GOAT.",

He is the type of person who makes me feel like going through the admissions season once again, for he really made that phase feel like a 'wonderful journey' instead of a 'war'. Apart from blessing us with his top-notch resources, unparalled teaching methodology, attention to detail, and ever-so precious guidance, Tthrvy also managed to forge one of the most wholesome communities that I've ever been in. Thrvy was the unbreakable foundation, while these amazing people were like the pillars, together forming a structure strong enough to help anyone weather this magnitude-8 type of earthquake that we call the 'Admissions Season'. He is a person I could reach out to for literally anything, and of course, he never failed to give the perfect response. That being said, I'm ever grateful to you, bhai.

Tathir bhai puts effort like no other. You might even see this man giving up on himself but will never ever, i repeat never ever give up on you. May it be at the start of the day or at the middle of the night, he has always been there to help. I haven't seen anyone care for each and everyone of his students the way tathir bhai does. One really amazing aspect of his is how real he is; he will never sugarcoat anything and will always say what you NEED to hear, and not what you WANT to hear. Thank you tathir bhaiya for playing a part in making my admission phase worthwhile and i will undoubtedly. recommend his course to any aspirant out there. I love you",

In our first session, he asked me \"Tomar dp te IBA keno üò°\". That's how my journey started. Since then, it has been a roller coaster ride. I remember how I was always frustrated by his cancelling the classes. But at the end, he blew my mind by taking 50+ classes where we paid for only 24 of the classes. The late night sessions, the vocab jams, the long ass classroom posts - all of these made my admission journey a time of my life that I will never forget. And the class quality? I will say the best in the market. I also did some classes of other IBAites. Needless to say, none of them came close to tthrvy. Why? Because tthrvy always tries to improve his courses and finds new ways to help the candidates. Long story short - his course will be a part of my life forever.",

Specially the IBA 31st exam was a gamechanger for me. I learned a lot through that single exam. I honestly believe that if I didn't attend the exam on that. day,I wouldn‚Äôt be here today. The effort he put for remaking the 31st's question is really really praiseworthy. I will always look up to this person no matter what. Thank you, tthrvy. I will forever remain grateful to you.

He taught me not only how to solve it but also the mindset behind it, which in my opinion plays the most important role.
